# Repository Description

## Structure and Purpose

This repository contains various files related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary focus is on linguistic examples and explanations. The repository includes:

- `forward-speech-pattern.md`: A mathematical study of a forward-only conversational technique.
- `README.md`: Examples of distinguishing different language and behavioral conditions in multiple languages.

## Mathematical Description

Consider the repository as a set \( R \) containing different files \( F_i \). Each file \( F_i \) can be represented as a tuple \( (C_i, M_i) \), where \( C_i \) is the content of the file and \( M_i \) is the metadata associated with the file. The repository's structure can be described as:

\[ R = \{ F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n \} \]

where each \( F_i \) is defined as:

\[ F_i = (C_i, M_i) \]

The purpose of the repository is to provide resources and examples for understanding and applying NLP techniques.

## Python Code Examples

Here are some Python code examples illustrating key functionalities of the repository:

### Example 1: Loading and Displaying File Content

```python
import os

def load_file_content(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content

def display_file_content(file_path):
    content = load_file_content(file_path)
    print(content)

# Example usage
file_path = 'README.md'
display_file_content(file_path)
```

### Example 2: Analyzing Text for Language Patterns

```python
import re

def analyze_text(text):
    # Example pattern: Count occurrences of the word 'language'
    pattern = re.compile(r'\blanguage\b', re.IGNORECASE)
    matches = pattern.findall(text)
    return len(matches)

# Example usage
text = load_file_content('README.md')
language_count = analyze_text(text)
print(f"The word 'language' appears {language_count} times in the text.")
```

### Example 3: Extracting Metadata from Files

```python
import os
import time

def extract_metadata(file_path):
    metadata = {
        'file_name': os.path.basename(file_path),
        'file_size': os.path.getsize(file_path),
        'creation_time': time.ctime(os.path.getctime(file_path)),
        'modification_time': time.ctime(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
    }
    return metadata

# Example usage
metadata = extract_metadata('README.md')
print(metadata)
```

These examples demonstrate how to load and display file content, analyze text for specific language patterns, and extract metadata from files within the repository.
