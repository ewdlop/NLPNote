- **Multiple Formats**: Text and JSON report generation
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple texts efficiently
- **Framework Integration**: Works with existing HumanExpressionEvaluator
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 27 test cases covering all scenarios

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
from DarkNLPAnalyzer import DarkNLPAnalyzer

analyzer = DarkNLPAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_text("You must act now! Everyone else is buying!")
print(f"Risk Score: {result.overall_risk_score:.2f}")
```

### Content Moderation Pipeline
```python
def moderate_content(text):
    result = analyzer.analyze_text(text)
    if result.overall_risk_score > 0.7:
        return "BLOCK"
    elif result.overall_risk_score > 0.3:
        return "REVIEW"
    else:
        return "ALLOW"
```

### Detailed Report Generation
```python
report = analyzer.generate_report(result, "text")
print(report)  # Comprehensive analysis report
```
