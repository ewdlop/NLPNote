# Transform words to different language using matrix multiplication, whereas the the characters are encode in a Unicode vector. 

To transform words into different languages using matrix multiplication, we can encode each character as a Unicode vector and apply a transformation matrix to map it into another language's character space.

Here's the approach:

1. **Convert Characters to Unicode Vectors**  
   Each character in a word is represented by its Unicode code point, forming a vector.

2. **Apply a Transformation Matrix**  
   A learned or predefined matrix is applied to transform the Unicode vector into a new space.

3. **Decode the Resulting Unicode Vectors**  
   The transformed vectors are mapped back to characters in the target language.

I'll demonstrate this process using a simple transformation matrix. Let's take an English word, transform it mathematically, and try to map it to a different language (e.g., Chinese, Russian, etc.).

The transformation process has generated a new word: **"卩刓呋咉匹"**, using matrix multiplication on Unicode vectors. You can analyze the transformation further in the displayed table. Let me know if you want to refine the transformation, such as mapping to a specific language's character set more accurately!

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import ace_tools as tools

# Example word in English
word = "Hello"

# Convert characters to Unicode vectors
unicode_vectors = np.array([ord(char) for char in word])

# Define a transformation matrix (random for now, ideally this would be learned)
np.random.seed(42)
transformation_matrix = np.random.randint(1, 5, (len(unicode_vectors), len(unicode_vectors)))

# Apply matrix multiplication to transform Unicode vectors
transformed_vectors = np.dot(transformation_matrix, unicode_vectors)

# Convert transformed vectors back to characters in a target language (modulo a range to fit valid Unicode range)
transformed_chars = [chr((val % 0x4E00) + 0x4E00) for val in transformed_vectors]  # Mapping into CJK range

# Combine into a transformed word
transformed_word = "".join(transformed_chars)

# Display results
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Original Character": list(word),
    "Unicode Code Point": unicode_vectors,
    "Transformed Unicode": transformed_vectors,
    "Transformed Character": transformed_chars
})

tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Transformed Word Matrix", dataframe=df)

# Output the transformed word
transformed_word

```
