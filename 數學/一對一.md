# Optimizers

Optimizers are algorithms or methods used to adjust parameters in a model to minimize or maximize an objective function, commonly used in machine learning, deep learning, and optimization problems. Here’s an overview of different types of optimizers:

### **1. Gradient-Based Optimizers**
These are commonly used in deep learning and machine learning for training models.

#### **First-Order Optimizers**
- **Gradient Descent (GD):** Updates parameters using the gradient of the loss function.
  - **Batch Gradient Descent (BGD):** Uses the entire dataset for each update.
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Uses a single random sample for each update.
  - **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** Uses a subset (mini-batch) for each update.

- **Momentum-Based Optimizers:** Reduce oscillations and improve convergence.
  - **Momentum:** Adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update.
  - **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG):** Looks ahead before computing the gradient.

- **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers:**
  - **Adagrad:** Adjusts learning rates based on past gradients (suitable for sparse data).
  - **RMSprop:** Improves Adagrad by normalizing gradients to avoid vanishing updates.
  - **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):** Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates.
  - **Nadam:** Adam with Nesterov momentum for better convergence.

#### **Second-Order Optimizers**
- **Newton’s Method:** Uses second-order derivatives (Hessian matrix) for optimization.
- **Quasi-Newton Methods:** Approximate second derivatives without computing the Hessian (e.g., BFGS).

### **2. Evolutionary & Metaheuristic Optimizers**
These are used for global optimization problems.

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** Mimics natural selection for optimization.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Simulates social behavior of particles in a swarm.
- **Simulated Annealing (SA):** Mimics the annealing process in metallurgy.
- **Differential Evolution (DE):** Uses differential mutation strategies for optimization.

### **3. Bayesian & Probabilistic Optimizers**
- **Bayesian Optimization:** Uses Gaussian processes to model the function being optimized.
- **CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy):** A population-based evolutionary strategy for complex optimization problems.

### **4. Constraint-Based & Mathematical Programming Optimizers**
- **Linear Programming (LP):** Optimizes a linear objective function with linear constraints.
- **Quadratic Programming (QP):** Similar to LP but with quadratic constraints.
- **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP):** Handles integer constraints.
- **Lagrange Multipliers:** Used for constrained optimization.

### **5. Quantum & Physics-Based Optimizers**
- **Quantum Annealing:** Leverages quantum mechanics to find global minima.
- **Simulated Quantum Annealing:** Classical simulation of quantum optimization.
