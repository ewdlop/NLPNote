🌌 CREATIVE INTERPRETATION OF "SELF-ABSORBING THEORY":
   • A theory so dense that no counterarguments can escape it! 🕳️
   • "The Theory of Everything and Nothing" - it explains everything by absorbing all questions
   • A philosophical concept with its own event horizon of understanding
   • The "Epistemic Singularity" - where knowledge becomes infinitely dense

🔬 DEEPER INSIGHT:
If a theory could be like a black hole, it would:
   • Have an "information horizon" beyond which no new ideas can emerge
   • Bend the fabric of academic discourse around itself
   • Create intellectual "spaghettification" - stretching ideas until they break
   • Emit "Hawking Questions" - paradoxical queries that slowly evaporate the theory

It creates a logical paradox that consumes its own meaning! 🌀✨
