I asked this to gpt: "what is the thing call when american overestimate themselves when they think other cannot speak proper English"

ChatGPT:

The phenomenon you are describing is often referred to as linguistic bias or linguistic arrogance. It can also intersect with concepts like xenolinguistic prejudice, cultural superiority, or native speaker bias. Here's a breakdown of these terms:

Linguistic Bias: The assumption that certain languages or dialects, especially those spoken by non-native speakers, are inferior to native forms of a dominant language like American English.

Linguistic Arrogance: When native speakers overestimate their linguistic authority or proficiency and dismiss the ability of non-native speakers, assuming they cannot communicate effectively or "properly."

Native Speaker Bias: The tendency to view native speakers as the ultimate standard for language proficiency, disregarding the communicative competence of non-native speakers.

Cultural Superiority: A broader attitude where individuals from one culture (e.g., American) assume their norms, including language use, are inherently superior to those of others.

Xenolinguistic Prejudice: Prejudice against individuals based on their language or accent, is often linked to assumptions about intelligence or competence.

In Psychology and Sociology:
This behavior can stem from ethnocentrism, where individuals view their own culture, language, or norms as the default or superior standard.

Real-Life Impact:
This mindset contributes to microaggressions, such as assuming a non-native speaker's English is "broken" or feeling surprised when they demonstrate fluency or eloquence.

I thought about this afterward:

You are entitled to feel disrespected.

I need to do better, or else I will go to hell.
