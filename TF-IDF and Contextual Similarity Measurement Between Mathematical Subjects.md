# TF-IDF and Contextual Similarity Measurement Between Mathematical Subjects

### **TF-IDF and Contextual Similarity Measurement Between Mathematical Subjects**

When comparing the similarity of mathematical subjects using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **contextual similarity**, we are essentially trying to measure how closely related different mathematical fields are based on their textual representations (e.g., definitions, theorems, concepts).

## **1. TF-IDF for Mathematical Subjects**
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is widely used in information retrieval and text similarity analysis.

### **Steps to Compute TF-IDF for Mathematical Subjects:**
1. **Corpus Creation**: Gather textual descriptions of different mathematical subjects (e.g., Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Topology, Number Theory).
2. **Tokenization & Preprocessing**: Remove stopwords, tokenize, and normalize mathematical terms.
3. **TF (Term Frequency)**: Count occurrences of each term within a subject.
4. **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)**: Compute the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of documents containing the term.
5. **TF-IDF Calculation**: Multiply TF by IDF for each term.

This results in a weighted representation of terms in different mathematical subjects, highlighting unique and important words.

## **2. Contextual Similarity (Word Embeddings & NLP)**
While TF-IDF is effective for keyword-based similarity, **contextual similarity** using word embeddings and transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT, Sentence-BERT) provides a richer understanding.

### **Approaches for Contextual Similarity:**
1. **Word2Vec / FastText / GloVe**:
   - Create vector embeddings for words appearing in mathematical subjects.
   - Compute cosine similarity between subjects based on their vector representations.

2. **Sentence Transformers (e.g., SBERT, GPT-based models)**:
   - Convert entire subject descriptions into dense vector representations.
   - Measure **cosine similarity** between subject embeddings to determine closeness.

3. **Graph-Based Similarity (Concept Graphs)**:
   - Construct a knowledge graph linking mathematical subjects based on shared concepts.
   - Use PageRank, Jaccard similarity, or adjacency matrices for measuring relatedness.

## **3. Implementing TF-IDF and Contextual Similarity**
I'll implement both **TF-IDF similarity** and **BERT-based contextual similarity** for mathematical subjects using Python. Letâ€™s analyze their similarity based on descriptions from Wikipedia or other sources.

It looks like the `sentence-transformers` library is not available in this environment. I can proceed with **TF-IDF similarity** and explore alternative contextual similarity approaches using available libraries. Let me recalculate the similarity matrix using TF-IDF first.

I have generated the **TF-IDF similarity matrix** for the mathematical subjects. You can analyze how closely related each subject is based on their textual descriptions. Let me know if you need further analysis, such as alternative similarity measurements or deeper insights.
