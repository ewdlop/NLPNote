无法空者，有人言：无法，名法已灭，是灭无故，名无法空。
有法空者，诸法因缘和合生故，无有法，有法无故，名有法空。
无法有法空者，取无法、有法相不可得，是为无法有法空。
复次、观无法有法空故，名无法有法空。
复次、行者观诸法生灭，若有门，若无门，生门生喜，灭门生忧，行者观生法空，则灭喜心，观灭法空，则灭忧心，所以者何？生无所得，灭无所失，除世间贪忧故，是名无法有法空。
复次、十八空中，初三空，破一切法，后三空，亦破一切法。有法空，破一切法生时住时；无法空，破一切法灭时；无法有法空，生灭一时俱破。
复次、有人言：过去、未来法空，是名无法空；现在及无为法空，是名有法空，何以故？过去法灭失，变异归无，未来法因缘未和合，未生未有，未出未起，以是故名无法；观知现在法及无为法，现有是名有法；是二俱空故，名为无法有法空。
复次、有人言：无为法，无生住灭，是名无法；有为法，生住灭，是名有法；如是等空，名为无法有法空。

#STOP #Concordance 

Concordance has multiple meanings, including a list of words in a book, an agreement, or a model for re-entry into society: 
List of words
An alphabetical list of words in a book or body of work, along with each instance of the word and its context. For example, a concordance of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress would list all the words used in the book in alphabetical order. 
Agreement
When everything agrees, or when things are in harmony. For example, your words may be in concordance with your actions if they express the same thing. 
Re-entry model
A model that addresses the inequities that lead people to commit crimes and return to prison. Concordance's model brings together 12 services to help people heal and prepare for a successful return to their community. 
Other meanings
