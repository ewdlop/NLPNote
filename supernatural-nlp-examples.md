# Supernatural Language Processing Examples

This document provides practical examples of using the SupernaturalNLP framework to analyze text using supersymmetric principles from mathematical physics.

## Basic Usage

```python
from SupernaturalNLP import SupernaturalNLP

# Initialize the processor
super_nlp = SupernaturalNLP(dimension=100)

# Analyze text
text = "Love conquers all obstacles"
results = super_nlp.supersymmetric_transform(text)

# Find superpartners
for word in results['original_words']:
    superpartner = super_nlp.find_superpartner(word)
    print(f"{word} ↔ {superpartner}")
```

## Advanced Examples

### 1. Quantum Semantic Entanglement Analysis

Analyze how words are quantum-entangled in meaning space:

```python
# Calculate entanglement between word pairs
words = ["love", "hate", "peace", "war", "light", "dark"]

print("Quantum Entanglement Matrix:")
for i, word1 in enumerate(words):
    for word2 in words[i+1:]:
        entanglement = super_nlp.quantum_semantic_entanglement(word1, word2)
        print(f"{word1:>8} ⟷ {word2:<8}: {entanglement:.3f}")
```

### 2. Supersymmetry Breaking in Poetry

Analyze where linguistic supersymmetry breaks down in poetic text:

```python
poem = """
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.
"""

breaking_analysis = super_nlp.detect_supersymmetry_breaking(poem)
print(f"Poetic symmetry score: {breaking_analysis['symmetry_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Symmetry breaking words: {breaking_analysis['broken_words']}")
```

### 3. Holographic Language Encoding

Apply the holographic principle to understand syntax-semantics duality:

```python
complex_text = "The mysterious quantum cat simultaneously exists and doesn't exist in the garden"

holographic = super_nlp.holographic_language_encoding(complex_text)

print("Holographic Analysis:")
print(f"Boundary (syntax) entropy: {holographic['boundary']['boundary_entropy']:.3f}")
print(f"Dimension reduction ratio: {holographic['holographic_duality']['dimension_reduction']:.3f}")

# Show entanglement network
network = holographic['bulk']['semantic_entanglement_network']
print("\nStrongest semantic entanglements:")
sorted_pairs = sorted(network.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
for (word1, word2), strength in sorted_pairs:
    print(f"  {word1} ⟷ {word2}: {strength:.3f}")
```

## Theoretical Applications

### 1. Word Superpartner Discovery

The framework automatically discovers linguistic duality relationships:

```python
# Common word dualities discovered by the system
dualities = [
    ("light", "lighting"),
    ("run", "running"), 
    ("quick", "quickly"),
    ("strong", "stronger"),
    ("create", "creating")
]

for word1, expected in dualities:
    found = super_nlp.find_superpartner(word1)
    print(f"{word1} → {found} (expected: {expected})")
```

### 2. Supersymmetric Invariant Analysis

Analyze which linguistic properties are preserved under supersymmetric transformations:

```python
words = ["beautiful", "harmony", "consciousness", "reality"]

for word in words:
    superfield = super_nlp.create_superfield(word)
    transformed = super_nlp.susy_generator.transform_word(word, superfield)
    invariants = super_nlp._calculate_supersymmetric_invariants(superfield, transformed)
    
    print(f"\n{word.upper()} Analysis:")
    print(f"  Bosonic norm ratio: {invariants['bosonic_norm_ratio']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Fermionic components: {invariants['fermionic_components']}")
    print(f"  Auxiliary conservation: {invariants['auxiliary_conservation']}")
```

### 3. Multiverse Semantic Analysis

Explore multiple semantic interpretations simultaneously:

```python
ambiguous_text = "The bank by the river"

# Create superposition of meanings
results = super_nlp.supersymmetric_transform(ambiguous_text)

print("Superposition of interpretations:")
for word in results['original_words']:
    superfield = results['superfields'][word]
    if word == 'bank':
        print(f"  {word}: financial_institution ⊕ river_edge")
        print(f"    Semantic uncertainty: {len(superfield.fermionic)} quantum states")
```

## Integration with Existing NLP

The SupernaturalNLP framework can enhance traditional NLP approaches:

```python
# Traditional approach
traditional_similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)

# Supernatural approach
quantum_entanglement = super_nlp.quantum_semantic_entanglement(word1, word2)

# Combined approach
enhanced_similarity = (traditional_similarity + quantum_entanglement) / 2
```

## Performance Considerations

For large texts, use batch processing:

```python
def batch_supernatural_analysis(texts, batch_size=10):
    """Process large collections of texts efficiently."""
    results = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size):
        batch = texts[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_results = []
        
        for text in batch:
            result = super_nlp.supersymmetric_transform(text)
            batch_results.append(result)
        
        results.extend(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

## Visualization Ideas

While this implementation focuses on computation, the results can be visualized:

1. **Entanglement Networks**: Graph visualization of quantum semantic entanglements
2. **Superspace Projections**: 2D/3D projections of high-dimensional superfields
3. **Symmetry Breaking Heatmaps**: Visual representation of where supersymmetry breaks
4. **Holographic Duality Diagrams**: Boundary-bulk correspondence visualizations

## Future Extensions

Potential enhancements to the framework:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train neural networks respecting supersymmetric principles
2. **Multilingual Supersymmetry**: Extend to cross-language superpartner discovery
3. **Temporal Supersymmetry**: Apply to historical language evolution
4. **Cognitive Supersymmetry**: Model human language processing with SUSY principles

## Conclusion

The SupernaturalNLP framework opens new possibilities for understanding language through the lens of mathematical physics. By treating linguistic structures as supersymmetric quantum fields, we can uncover hidden symmetries and dualities in natural language that traditional NLP approaches might miss.

The "supernatural" aspects emerge from the quantum-like properties of meaning, where words exist in superposition states until observed (interpreted), and where distant parts of text can exhibit non-local semantic correlations through quantum entanglement.
