# English Language Patching Guide

This guide explains how to use the English language patching functionality in this NLP repository to automatically correct and improve English text.

## Overview

The English Language Patcher is a comprehensive tool that can automatically detect and fix common issues in English text including:

- **Spelling errors** (typos, common misspellings)
- **Grammar mistakes** (subject-verb agreement, article usage)
- **Punctuation issues** (spacing, missing punctuation)
- **Capitalization problems** (sentence beginnings, proper nouns)
- **Style improvements** (contractions, formal writing)
- **Text simplification** (complex vocabulary, sentence structure)

## Quick Start

### Using the Python EnglishPatcher

```python
from EnglishPatcher import EnglishPatcher

# Create an instance of the patcher
patcher = EnglishPatcher()

# Basic usage
text = "teh quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.can you beleive it?"
result = patcher.patch_text(text)

print("Original:", result.original_text)
print("Patched: ", result.patched_text)
print("Applied", len(result.patches), "patches")

# Get detailed information about patches
summary = patcher.get_patch_summary(result)
print(summary)
```

### Text Simplification (NEW!)

Make complex English text easier to read and understand:

```python
# Simplify complex text
complex_text = "Subsequently, we must utilize comprehensive methodology to facilitate the optimization process"
simplified = patcher.simplify_text(complex_text)

print("Complex:    ", simplified.original_text)
print("Simplified: ", simplified.patched_text)
# Output: "Later, we must use comprehensive method to help the optimization process"

# Or use with patch_text
result = patcher.patch_text(text, simplify=True)
```

### Using the C# ApplyAscentMark Tool

The enhanced C# tool now includes English language detection and patching:

```bash
# Compile and run (if you have .NET SDK)
dotnet run --project ApplyAscentMark.csproj

# Or use the interactive mode
Enter your sentence: I is going to the store
Detected Context: English
English Patched: I am going to the store
Final Result: I am going to the store
```

## Features

### 1. Spelling Correction

Automatically fixes common typos and misspellings:

```python
# Examples of spelling corrections
"teh" → "the"
"recieve" → "receive"
"seperate" → "separate"
"definately" → "definitely"
"beleive" → "believe"
```

### 2. Grammar Checking

Fixes common grammatical errors:

```python
# Subject-verb agreement
"I is going" → "I am going"
"You is correct" → "You are correct"
"She are coming" → "She is coming"

# Article usage
"a example" → "an example"
"an book" → "a book"

# Double negatives
"don't have no money" → "don't have any money"
```

### 3. Punctuation and Spacing

Corrects punctuation and spacing issues:

```python
# Add space after punctuation
"Hello,world" → "Hello, world"
"What time is it?I don't know" → "What time is it? I don't know"

# Remove extra spaces
"This  has   multiple    spaces" → "This has multiple spaces"

# Remove space before punctuation
"Hello , world" → "Hello, world"
```

### 4. Capitalization

Ensures proper capitalization:

```python
# Capitalize sentence beginnings
"hello world" → "Hello world"
"the cat ran.the dog followed" → "The cat ran. The dog followed"
```

### 5. Style Improvements (Aggressive Mode)

In aggressive mode, provides style improvements:

```python
# Expand contractions for formal writing
"can't" → "cannot"
"won't" → "will not"
"don't" → "do not"
```

### 6. Text Simplification

Makes complex English easier to read and understand:

```python
# Simplify academic vocabulary
"utilize" → "use"
"facilitate" → "help"
"subsequently" → "later"
"demonstrate" → "show"

# Simplify business language
"commence" → "begin"
"obtain" → "get"
"sufficient" → "enough"
"accomplish" → "do"

# Sentence structure improvements
"The report was completed by the team" → "The team completed the report"
```

## Usage Modes

### Conservative Mode (Default)

Only applies high-confidence corrections:

```python
result = patcher.patch_text(text)  # Conservative by default
```

### Aggressive Mode

Applies additional style improvements and lower-confidence corrections:

```python
result = patcher.patch_text(text, aggressive=True)
```

### Simplification Mode

Makes text easier to read by simplifying complex vocabulary and structure:

```python
result = patcher.patch_text(text, simplify=True)
# or use the convenience method
result = patcher.simplify_text(text)
```

### Combined Modes

You can combine different modes for comprehensive text improvement:

```python
# Fix errors and simplify
result = patcher.patch_text(text, aggressive=True, simplify=True)
```

## API Reference

### EnglishPatcher Class

#### Methods

- `patch_text(text: str, aggressive: bool = False, simplify: bool = False) -> PatchResult`
  - Main method to patch English text
  - `aggressive`: Apply more aggressive style corrections
  - `simplify`: Apply text simplification for easier reading
  - Returns a PatchResult with original text, patched text, and applied patches

- `simplify_text(text: str) -> PatchResult`
  - Convenience method for text simplification
  - Equivalent to `patch_text(text, simplify=True)`

- `get_patch_summary(result: PatchResult) -> str`
  - Generates a human-readable summary of applied patches

#### PatchResult Class

- `original_text: str` - The original input text
- `patched_text: str` - The corrected text
- `patches: List[Patch]` - List of all patches applied
- `success_rate: float` - Ratio of patches to words (0.0 to 1.0)

#### Patch Class

- `original: str` - The original text that was corrected
- `corrected: str` - The corrected text
- `position: int` - Position in the original text
- `patch_type: PatchType` - Type of correction (SPELLING, GRAMMAR, etc.)
- `confidence: float` - Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- `explanation: str` - Human-readable explanation of the correction

## Integration with Other Tools

### American English Directory

The `American English/` directory contains resources specifically for American English processing:

- **English courses.md** - Educational resources and integration guides
- **An intelligent is artificial.md** - Discussion on AI and language processing
- **A vague context.md** - Handling ambiguous language situations

### HumanExpressionEvaluator Integration

The English patcher can be used alongside the HumanExpressionEvaluator for comprehensive text analysis:

```python
from EnglishPatcher import EnglishPatcher
from HumanExpressionEvaluator import HumanExpressionEvaluator

patcher = EnglishPatcher()
evaluator = HumanExpressionEvaluator()

# First patch the text
result = patcher.patch_text(text)

# Then evaluate the expression
evaluation = evaluator.evaluate(result.patched_text, context)
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

```python
from EnglishPatcher import EnglishPatcher

patcher = EnglishPatcher()
text = "teh student recieve there grades and they is very happy"
result = patcher.patch_text(text, aggressive=True)

print("Original:", text)
print("Patched: ", result.patched_text)
# Output: "The student receive their grades and they are very happy"
```

### Detailed Analysis

```python
# Get detailed patch information
for patch in result.patches:
    print(f"{patch.patch_type.value}: {patch.original} → {patch.corrected}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {patch.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"  Explanation: {patch.explanation}")
```

### Real-world Use Cases

1. **Educational Tools**: Help language learners identify and correct mistakes
2. **Content Review**: Automatically improve draft documents
3. **Chat Applications**: Clean up user input before processing
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize text data for NLP tasks

## Configuration

### Adding Custom Typo Corrections

Extend the common typos dictionary in `_load_common_typos()`:

```python
# Add domain-specific corrections
custom_typos = {
    'tecnology': 'technology',
    'managment': 'management',
    # Add more as needed
}
```

### Adding Grammar Rules

Add new grammar patterns in `_load_grammar_rules()`:

```python
# Add custom grammar rules
custom_rules = [
    (r'\bI am went\b', 'I went', "Corrected verb tense"),
    # Add more patterns
]
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_english_patcher.py
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for each correction type
- Integration tests with multiple error types
- Performance tests for different text lengths
- Real-world example tests

## Performance

The English patcher is designed for high performance:

- **Short texts**: ~50,000+ words per second
- **Medium texts**: ~200,000+ words per second  
- **Long texts**: ~400,000+ words per second

Performance scales well with text length due to optimized regex patterns and efficient patch application.

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Context Dependency**: Some corrections require human judgment (e.g., "their" vs "there")
2. **Domain Specificity**: Technical or specialized texts may need custom rules
3. **Cultural Variations**: Focused on American English conventions
4. **Creative Writing**: May not be suitable for intentionally non-standard text

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Machine learning-based correction suggestions
- Context-aware homophone correction
- Integration with external spell-checking APIs
- Support for British English conventions
- Advanced style analysis and suggestions

## Contributing

To contribute new features or corrections:

1. Add test cases in `test_english_patcher.py`
2. Implement corrections in `EnglishPatcher.py`
3. Update this documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No patches applied**: Check if text is already correct or uses non-standard patterns
2. **Incorrect corrections**: May need to adjust confidence thresholds or add exceptions
3. **Performance issues**: Consider breaking large texts into smaller chunks

### Debug Mode

Use individual patch functions for debugging:

```python
# Test specific correction types
spelling_result = patcher._apply_spelling_patches(text)
grammar_result = patcher._apply_grammar_patches(text, False)
punct_result = patcher._apply_punctuation_patches(text)
```
