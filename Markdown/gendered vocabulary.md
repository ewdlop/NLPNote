In Portuguese, gendered vocabulary is common, as the language assigns grammatical gender (masculine and feminine) to nouns, adjectives, and some verb forms. Here’s a breakdown of how gender works in Portuguese vocabulary:

### 1. **Nouns**
   - **Masculine nouns** often end in **-o** (e.g., *amigo* - male friend).
   - **Feminine nouns** often end in **-a** (e.g., *amiga* - female friend).
   - Exceptions exist, such as *mão* (hand, feminine) and *poeta* (poet, masculine).

### 2. **Adjectives**
   - Adjectives change to agree with the gender of the noun they describe:
     - Masculine: *bonito* (handsome).
     - Feminine: *bonita* (beautiful).
   - Adjectives that end in **-e** or **-ista** generally do not change:
     - *inteligente* (intelligent, applies to both genders).

### 3. **Articles**
   - Definite articles: *o* (masculine), *a* (feminine).
     - E.g., *o carro* (the car, masculine), *a casa* (the house, feminine).
   - Indefinite articles: *um* (masculine), *uma* (feminine).
     - E.g., *um amigo* (a male friend), *uma amiga* (a female friend).

### 4. **Pronouns**
   - Masculine: *ele* (he), *o* (him).
   - Feminine: *ela* (she), *a* (her).
   - Neutral pronouns are not traditionally used, but modern movements for inclusivity promote *elu* (they, singular).

### 5. **Occupational Titles**
   - Many titles have gendered forms:
     - Masculine: *professor* (male teacher).
     - Feminine: *professora* (female teacher).
   - Some titles remain neutral or are becoming gender-neutral through usage:
     - *dentista* (dentist, applicable to both genders).

### 6. **Plural Forms**
   - Masculine plural is used as the default for mixed-gender groups:
     - *amigos* (friends, male or mixed group).
   - Feminine plural applies to all-female groups:
     - *amigas* (female friends).

### 7. **Efforts Toward Inclusivity**
   - Some use **-e** or **-x** for gender neutrality:
     - *amigue* or *amigx* instead of *amigo/amiga*.
   - Others use the **@** symbol (*amig@*), though it’s less common now.

Gendered vocabulary in Portuguese is deeply ingrained, but evolving practices reflect increasing awareness of inclusivity.
